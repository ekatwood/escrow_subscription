Solving monthly payments for blockchain

Subscription model is difficult with blockchain, because you have to sign every transaction.

I propose a simple solution: the user puts in say $100 for a $10 / month subscription, and pre-approves the transactions on a schedule (once a month for 10 months). The value is stored in a smart contract in escrow, where it can be staked while it sits there. The user can also cancel their subscription early and get the rest of their value back from the escrow smart contract.

The front end will be a simple web app, and ideally users could pay with $USDC or any major accepted stable coin for mainstream subscriptions like Netflix or Spotify.

It should also be easy enough for users to set up their own custom subscription model, say for a website they built or some other online service they are offering for a monthly rate.
